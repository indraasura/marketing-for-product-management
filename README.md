## Social Media Strategies 

### Developing a Social Media Strategy (SMS)

#### Need of an SMS

* Helps shape conversations, build loyalty and attract new customers and partners. 
* Expands other marketing efforts as your content has the chance to be seen by a wider and the right audience. 
* Builds brand awareness - 84% customers buy from a brand that they follow 

##### Important part of SMS 

* Buyer Persona 
Helps determine who ideal customers are - helps make SMS decisions 

* Aligning social strategy and business objectives - create SMART SMS goals that take business objectives into consideration 

Note: Articulate SMGs (Social Media Goals) and the effect they'll have on ROI to secure executive buy-in and budget for SM campaigns

### KPIs in SMGs 

* A KPI is a quantifiable measure used to evaluate the success of an organization, employee, or project in meeting objectives for performance.

* Be aware of "vanity metrics" - surface level metrics made up of numbers that seem great on paper but not be as such in real life scenarios. For example - The number of followers (Looks good but how many of the followers are actually interested in your product?)

#### Four categories of KPIs to consider

1. Reach : Most vanity prone
    * Follower count
    * Impressions
    * Mentions
    * Share of voice - how much has your product been talked instead of competitors'

2. Engagement
    * Likes, favorites, saved
    * Comments
    * Sharing, retweets
    * Customer ratings and reviews
    * Inbound website links from Social Media

3. ROI
    * Direct sales revenue from SM
    * Lead conversions from SM campaigns 
    * Support cost(s) per customer
    * Lifetime value - projected revenue a customer will generate in their lifetime 

4. Retention and loyalty
    * Reviews and ratings
    * SLAs (Service Level Agreement) - how long it takes for SM handle to respond to customers (Different from Inbound Marketing SLA)
    * Time to resolution - time taken to resolve customer query
    * Customer satisfaction

Make sure to visit KPIs and revise them (if necessary) every 6 months or on a yearly basis

### Structuring SMTs (Social Media Teams)

Tips to form a good SMT: 

1. Consider company's goals
2. Consider what the stakeholders care about
3. Outline SM roadblocks and have people who can overcome these roadblocks
4. Develop timeline for reaching goals, allocate resources
5. Create a SM roadmap from the timeline and assess KPIs

#### Different SMT models

1. ##### Decentralized Model
No specific department manages or coordinates content
and strategy. The team shares responsibilities and ideas. A decentralized model tends to be representative of organizations in the early stages of implementing social.

2. ##### Centralized Model
A centralized team is one that stands alone and manages all activities.

3. ##### Hub and Spoke model - most common in growing companies
One team coordinates with other groups within the organization

4. ##### Dandelio - multiple hub and spoke modela main social media
A main social media team works with smaller social media teams in different departments or business units - mainly used in companies with international offices

5. ##### Holistic model
Everyone is involved - requires great trust and training 

### Developing a SM budget and garnering executive buy-in

Always develop a budget after creating an SMS. 
Consider the following when developing a budget: 

* What social content do you think you’ll need to create?
* Can you do it in-house or will you need to hire freelancers or an agency?
* What is your ideal mix of organic and paid advertising? How much advertising do you think
you’ll require?
* Are you considering paying influencers to help you promote your products?
* Do you have the right staffing for your plan?
* Which services or tools do you think you need? How much will they cost?

Next, gather industry data and competitive information to back up your plan. To garner executive buy-in, tell them why your plan will make or save them money. Demonstrate projected ROI. Show them
statistics to back up your claim.

##### What if you have no idea how much money to spend? 

If you don’t have any program in place yet and you are arguing for the money to start the project,
position it as an experiment or a pilot. Develop a plan that starts with the business goal, then your
hypothesis on why social media can help meet that goal. Demonstrate how you will test that
hypothesis and for what duration. Most importantly, explain how you will share the results with the
leadership team. In this case, you may want to ask for a modified budget for the experiment to
prove value first.

###### Tip: Try the $1 a day approach where you spend a dollar each day and analyze - if good, spend more

### Content that is not generated by you
